In this presentation, I give an intuitive understanding to polar codes and explain the mechanics of the proof of their working using Martingale techniques and concentration inequalities. This project was done under the guidance of Prof. Abhishek Sinha, for the course *EE6112 â€“ Topics on Random Processes and Concentration Inequalities*.
