I am currently part of a team guided by [Prof. Devendra Jalihal](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/user/dj1/) and [Prof. Radhakrishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/rganti/). My master's thesis is under the guidance of Prof. Devendra Jalihal on the topic of blind signal detection and separation in the presence of strong interference.
