I was part of the contingent representing IIT Madras in two events at the Inter IIT Tech Meet in IIT Roorkee. The first event was Ashoka Tech for Social Change – my team presented a technology for aggregation of local scrap collectors, for which we won the bronze medal. The second event was a hackathon – my team designed a system for effective crowdsourcing of user information/complaints about public spaces, for which we won the gold medal.
